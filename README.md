# ra.ko 🟠🟨🟣🔵  
**iOS card game** inspired by *Beggar My Neighbor*, reimagined as a fast-paced, engaging experience that challenges **attention**, **reaction time**, and **focus** — without ever feeling like "training."

Built entirely with **SwiftUI**, the app uses simple rules and quick interactions to create a dynamic mental workout that feels like play.

## 🕹 Gameplay Mechanics

- Each player flips cards into a central pile
- If two identical cards appear in sequence → **first to tap wins the pile**
- If a special card (1, 2, or 3) is played, the next player must “pay” by placing 1–3 cards
- If no new special card appears, the previous player wins the entire pile

This flow encourages quick thinking, prediction, and sharp attention — without ever breaking immersion.

- **Short-term memory**

Play is the vehicle — any mental benefit is a natural side effect of how the game works.
