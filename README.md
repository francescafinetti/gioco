## 🕹 Gameplay Mechanics

- Each player flips cards into a central pile
- If two identical cards appear in sequence → **first to tap wins the pile**
- If a special card (Ace, 2, or 3) is played, the next player must “pay” by placing 1–3 cards
- If no new special card appears, the previous player wins the entire pile

This flow encourages quick thinking, prediction, and sharp attention — without ever breaking immersion.
